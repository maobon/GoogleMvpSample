# Kotlin Model View Presenter Simple example

#### This is simple Kotlin MVP demo. Here we are using following technologies

1. Clean MVP by Google
2. Retrofit
3. Github API  
4. Kotlin extentions 

#### Let us know!

We’d be really happy if you sent us links to your projects where you use our component. Just send an email to github@yalantis.com And do let us know if you have any questions or suggestion regarding the animation. 

P.S. We’re going to publish more awesomeness wrapped in code and a tutorial on how to make UI for Android (iOS) better than better. Stay tuned!
